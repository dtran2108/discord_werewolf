**RELEASE NOTES   |   [`21 August, 2019`]**

**Boo**   `[NEW BOT]`
Boo is a discord bot brings joy to people

**What’s new in version 1.0.0?**
•   Whole new commands.
•   Add data through developer tool.
•   Everyday news.
•   Trading.
•   AI (I think so).

**Commands**     `[NEW]`
•   `$help`: display help menu
•   `$hi` | `$hello`: This one is the AI thing, try this!
•   `$spell` | `$spelling`: Test yourself with Vietnamese/English spellings.
•   `$slap`: Slap someone you hate.
•   `$buy`: Buy some items at the market.
•   `$me`: Display user's profile.

**Developer Tools**     `[NEW]`
[!] Read this carefully if you're interested in helping me import new data to the existing database, then ask me to provide you the `staff` role to access these tools.
•   `$help-dev`: Display help menu for developer.
•   `$emoup`: Update server's emojis, usually after you import new emojis to the server. We need to make sure the database have the latest emojis.
•   `$add_bless`: Add new conversations to the database (remember to follow exactly the same as the instruction in help menu), note : '\n' is a break-line. 
•   `$load_bless`: Load all the conversations to make sure the data in the database is the latest.
•   `$show_bless`: Display the last 5 conversations to check if our database is the latest. Also, remember to follow the instruction.
•   `$add_spell`: Add new spelling to database. This one is complicated, be careful while entering the arguments (you have to follow exactly the same as the instruction).

If Boo has any bug, fire away in <#604030221926268939>! Because this is part of my practice so I'm sorry if this release note annoys you (probably by its length :D) .
That's it! Enjoy your time with Boo.
