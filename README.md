# Boo

Boo is a discord bot brings joy to people.

## What's new in version 1.0.0?

- Whole new commands.
- Add data through developer tools.
- Everyday news.
- AI (I think so).

### Commands

- `$hi` | `$hello`: This one is the AI thing, try this!
- `$spell` | `$spelling`: Test yourself with Vietnamese/English spellings.
- `$slap`: slap someone you hate

### Developer tools

- `$help-dev`: Display help menu for developer.
- `$userup`: Update users' data (mainly new users).
- `$emoup`: Update server's emojis, usually after you import new emojis to the server. We need to make sure the database have the latest emojis.
- `$add_bless`: Add new conversations to the database (remember to follow exactly the same as the instruction in help menu), note : '\n' is a break-line. 
- `$load_bless`: Load all the conversations to make sure the data in the database is the latest.
- `$show_bless`: Display the last 5 conversations to check if our database is the latest. Also, remember to follow the instruction.
- `$add_spell`: Add new spelling to database. This one is complicated, be careful while entering the arguments (you have to follow exactly the same as the instruction).
